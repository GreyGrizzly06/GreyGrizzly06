# Zach Coats
Zach is a Computer Science teacher at Northside High School in Fort Smith, AR. Given that he teaches at his alma mater and the students sitting in his classes get younger every year, he often goes by the moniker **Grey Grizzly**. He has taught at Northside for 10 years, and 8 of those have involved teaching some sort of Computer Science.

### Daily  Work
Zach currently teaches four different courses in three different programming languages. Programming Years 1 and 2 are both taught in Python, AP Computer Science A is taught in Java (though he's hopeful a Python course is coming soon), and AP Computer Science Principles is taught in a drag-and-drop language called Snap!. In all of these courses, he does his best to thread Data Science through what the students are studying because Data Science is so much fun.

### Credentials
Zach holds a Bachelor of Science from the University of Arkansas and a Master of Computer and Information Sciences degree from Southern Arkansas University. He began pursuing the latter degree after getting tired of answering "I don't know" to the questions his students were asking in class. He still answers "I don't know" to student questions, but he at least knows where to start looking for the answers. If you need help with high school computer science pedagogy, he can probably get you pointed in the right direction.

### Major Projects
Zach is looking forward to expanding his skill set, particularly here on GitHub. After years of saying he needed to figure out how GitHub Education works, he's finally taking the plunge and plans on using it in most if not all of his classes next year. If anyone has any advice on how to get a GitHub repository up and running for a high school classroom, he will listen (or read) very closely to what you have to say.

### Contact
If you want to contact Zach, he can be reached at zcoats@fortsmithschools.org. He usually gets through all his emails each business day, but when students start panicking about their grades, it can take up to a week for him to dig out from the avalanche of student requests for grade updates.
